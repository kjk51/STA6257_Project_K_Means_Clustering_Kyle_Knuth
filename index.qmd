#### Article Summary 1

This article is about using k means clustering to look for defects on
imported fruit since it is time consuming to do it manually. The
researchers’ goal is to segment an image of a fruit based off color
using k-means clustering to determine if the fruit has “gone bad”. First
the authors explain how k-means clustering works and how it is applied.
For example, the data is partitioned into clusters that have common
traits and each cluster has a cluster center that starts from seed
points. Then k-means clustering calculates the distance between each
data point and each cluster center and assigns the data point to the
closest center. In order to apply this to their current research
question, the images of the fruit are used and the pixels are clustered
by color and spatial features. The clustered pixels are then combined to
specific areas. The distribution of the intensity values is calculated
and then using ‘k’ random intensities the centroids are set. The image
points are clustered by distance of intensity values to the centroid. A
new centroid is then calculated and the previous two steps are repeated
until the labels of the clusters no longer change. In order to segment
the colors of the fruit, an image of the fruit was input and transformed
from RGB to L\*a\*b\*. The authors decided to use L\*a\*b\*  because of
the luminosity option and because all the color info is only in the a
and b layers. This made segmenting the colors easier. The colors were
classified in the a\*b\* layers and Euclidean distance was used to
measure difference between colors. Each pixel in the image was labeled
from k-means. K-means then computed the index corresponding to each
cluster for each pixel and the pixel is labeled with a cluster index.
Different images of the same fruit were then produced based on each
cluster. The results in the paper were very interesting. They were able
to very clearly separate a single image of a fruit into multiple based
of the coloring of that fruit. For example, they used an apple with scab
disease and were able to use k-means clustering to separate out the
diseased part of the apple. After some brief experimentation they
decided it was best to separate the images into 3 or 4 clusters. Too
many or too few would provide a lot of variability in detecting the
“bad” part of the fruit. [@dubey2013infected]

#### Article Summary 2

The goal of the author was to use a more objective method to assess
aquifer contamination. The normal method was to use Depth to water
table, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact
of vadose zone and hydraulic Conductivity (DRASTIC). The original
problem was that selecting weights for the DRASTIC method was
subjective. The author uses k means clustering to create a vulnerability
map that doesn’t use fixed weights and uses 4 of the original 7 DRASTIC
factors (DRIC). The author chose to do an analysis on an aquifer in Iran
and made separate vulnerability maps using DRASTIC and k means
clustering. The method of this analysis included creating a
vulnerability map with DRASTIC, performing Principal Component Analysis
to reduce the number of features, k means clustering was then used to
acquire clusters from the new dataset and in turn was used to create a
second vulnerability map. Lastly, the water quality of the aquifer was
analyzed by collecting samples over the area the aquifer encompassed and
both vulnerability maps were statistically compared to the water
quality. The author then explains how k means clustering takes an nxd
matrix and creates clusters in which data points are assigned. The
assignment begins randomly but then is rearranged to where each data
point is assigned to the nearest cluster. Using the Davie-Bouldin Index,
it was found that the best number of clusters was 5. Using Pearson’s
correlation coefficient to compare both vulnerability maps to the actual
water quality observations, it was found that the k means clustering
method better than the DRASTIC method. The author also found the p-value
from Student t-test to show that there was a significant difference.
