#### Article Summary 1

This article is about using k means clustering to look for defects on
imported fruit since it is time consuming to do it manually. The
researchers’ goal is to segment an image of a fruit based off color
using k-means clustering to determine if the fruit has “gone bad”. First
the authors explain how k-means clustering works and how it is applied.
For example, the data is partitioned into clusters that have common
traits and each cluster has a cluster center that starts from seed
points. Then k-means clustering calculates the distance between each
data point and each cluster center and assigns the data point to the
closest center. In order to apply this to their current research
question, the images of the fruit are used and the pixels are clustered
by color and spatial features. The clustered pixels are then combined to
specific areas. The distribution of the intensity values is calculated
and then using ‘k’ random intensities the centroids are set. The image
points are clustered by distance of intensity values to the centroid. A
new centroid is then calculated and the previous two steps are repeated
until the labels of the clusters no longer change. In order to segment
the colors of the fruit, an image of the fruit was input and transformed
from RGB to L\*a\*b\*. The authors decided to use L\*a\*b\*  because of
the luminosity option and because all the color info is only in the a
and b layers. This made segmenting the colors easier. The colors were
classified in the a\*b\* layers and Euclidean distance was used to
measure difference between colors. Each pixel in the image was labeled
from k-means. K-means then computed the index corresponding to each
cluster for each pixel and the pixel is labeled with a cluster index.
Different images of the same fruit were then produced based on each
cluster. The results in the paper were very interesting. They were able
to very clearly separate a single image of a fruit into multiple based
of the coloring of that fruit. For example, they used an apple with scab
disease and were able to use k-means clustering to separate out the
diseased part of the apple. After some brief experimentation they
decided it was best to separate the images into 3 or 4 clusters. Too
many or too few would provide a lot of variability in detecting the
“bad” part of the fruit. [@dubey2013infected]

#### Article Summary 2

The goal of the author was to use a more objective method to assess
aquifer contamination. The normal method was to use Depth to water
table, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact
of vadose zone and hydraulic Conductivity (DRASTIC). The original
problem was that selecting weights for the DRASTIC method was
subjective. The author uses k means clustering to create a vulnerability
map that doesn’t use fixed weights and uses 4 of the original 7 DRASTIC
factors (DRIC). The author chose to do an analysis on an aquifer in Iran
and made separate vulnerability maps using DRASTIC and k means
clustering. The method of this analysis included creating a
vulnerability map with DRASTIC, performing Principal Component Analysis
to reduce the number of features, k means clustering was then used to
acquire clusters from the new dataset and in turn was used to create a
second vulnerability map. Lastly, the water quality of the aquifer was
analyzed by collecting samples over the area the aquifer encompassed and
both vulnerability maps were statistically compared to the water
quality. The author then explains how k means clustering takes an nxd
matrix and creates clusters in which data points are assigned. The
assignment begins randomly but then is rearranged to where each data
point is assigned to the nearest cluster. Using the Davie-Bouldin Index,
it was found that the best number of clusters was 5. Using Pearson’s
correlation coefficient to compare both vulnerability maps to the actual
water quality observations, it was found that the k means clustering
method better than the DRASTIC method. The author also found the p-value
from Student t-test to show that there was a significant difference.

#### Article Summary 3

The main goal of the authors is to use k-means clustering on
pharmacokinetic parameters to predict chemotherapy response to bladder
cancer. K-means clustering was used to alleviate the limitations in
analyzing and interpreting the data gained from examining the
effectiveness of therapeutic treatments. The data was segmented into
clusters based off the distance of each individual data point to the
cluster center. They decided to use three clusters and they determined
the efficacy of the treatment by observing the changes of the cluster
volume from the start of the treatment to the halfway point. They based
each cluster off the amplitude and rate of microcirculation in the tumor
tissue. Cluster one had a low amplitude and low rate, cluster two had a
high amplitude and low rate, and cluster three had a high rate and low
amplitude. When comparing the clusters of responders (responsive bladder
cancer) and nonresponders (nonresponsive bladder cancer) of the
treatment, responders had larger volume reduction in clusters one and
three compared to cluster two. In nonresponders, cluster two had a
volume increase. By observing the changes in volume, the authors were
able to measure the tumor size before and after chemotherapy. They
measured the cluster volume fractions before and halfway through
treatment and found a 9% change in cluster one, a 17% change in cluster
two, and a 5% change in cluster three in responders. In nonrepsonders,
there was a 12 % change in cluster one, a 15% change in cluster two, and
a 3% change in cluster three. Overall, k-means clustering was able to
visualize the tumor from MRI’s as well as show the response of
chemotherapy. By using k-means clustering, they were able to use the
clusters as biomarkers to identify the effectiveness of chemo as well as
an indication of future tumor response to chemotherapy. Some limitations
in this study are that the sample size for nonresponders was small and
that motion correction wasn’t used in the analysis of the MRI data.

#### Article Summary 4

In this article the authors’ wanted to identify patterns of change in
skin pores using k-means clustering. Using three-dimensional
measurements, the authors’ looked for patterns of how pores change due
to age. Their measurements came from 101 Korean women’s cheeks. The skin
pores were grouped into five clusters based off the size, density, and
elongation of the pores. The pores were segmented by projecting the
three-dimensional surface into a two dimensional plane (depth map). The
intensities of the pixels corresponds to the z-coordinate. From there
the skin pores were segmented. Within each segmentation the area and
elongation was computed. The average pore size, pore elongation, and
pore densities were used as variables. The Elbow method, which was used
to find the best number of clusters in this study, consists of plotting
the sum of squared error versus K numbers and wherever the slope
plateaus indicated a potential cluster. The pores were clustered into
the five groups as follows: a few pores are detected and they are small,
the pores are larger and more detectable, the pores are even larger and
more detectable, then for the last two clusters the pores increase in
size and elongation but become harder to detect. The mean age of the
first cluster is 10.1, the mean age of the second cluster is 31.2, the
mean age of the third is 35.8, the mean age of the fourth is 48.6, and
the mean age of the fifth cluster is 55.8. According to the authors’,
the change in pores from clusters one and two may be due to puberty. The
results of this study show that pores become larger and more elongated
as one ages indicating that pores play a role in the appearance of
wrinkles and aging skin. Some limitations in this study are that data
regarding the patients lifestyles or health related conditions that
might explain the status of their pores was not available and the
detection of connected pores needed to be improved. The connected pores
cause significant increases in elongation.
